In Galilean Aramaic, the concept of the Holy Spirit... Notes:

- It is feminine in grammatical gender.
- That was changed to masculine in later Syriac.
- It can be formulated a number of different ways:
    - In Syriac and CPA it is ܪܘܚܐ ܕܩܘܕܫܐ.
    - In Galilean we see it {% gal "rwx qwd$h" %} (in Targum Neofiti Num 11:25).

It's important to note that grammatical gender in Aramaic, as in many other languages, does not *inherently* dictate a corresponding "feminine" or "masculine" characteristic in a substantive sense. However, it does offer a linguistic marker impacting phrasing and related constructions as well as the conception of various words in masculine or feminine contexts.

For example, in Jewish tradition, the Holy Spirit is associated with the personification of Wisdom.
