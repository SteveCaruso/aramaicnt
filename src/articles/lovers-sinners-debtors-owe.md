title: What Do Lovers, Sinners, and Debtors Owe?
---

[ROUGH NOTES]

- The words for "love" {% gal "xbb" %} and "debt/owe" {% gal "xwb" %} are very similar and Christ puns upon these.
- The word for "sin" {% gal "x+)" %} is irregular, but found vocalized in Palestinian Vocalization as {% gal "x:+E" %}.
